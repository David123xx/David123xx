- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @David123xx
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about programming languages and software lifecycles.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundementals of developing in C++, Java, and Python 3.  Last thing I learned was how to use basic wrapper to integrate Python 3 into C++.
As I complete more projects for college, I will be posting them in my repositories based on the ones I find interesting.
